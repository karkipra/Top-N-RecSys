#### Cleaning

- (Attempted using PySpark from Apache Spark) Used Python libraries Pandas and Numpy to process the Dataset and create a training set with limited variables (Overall Rating, ReviewID, ProductID).
  - Created a 2D matrix with these three variables.
  - Analysis of data - trends of ratings
- Incorporate metadata in the analysis (WIP)
